# spring-artifact-odds
Generate random Genshin artifacts from domains, numbers for drop rates are from the https://genshin-impact.fandom.com.
Those pages were most used in particular:
* https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_System/Artifact_Drop_Distribution: for the odds of rolling 3 or 4 substats.
* https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Artifact/Distribution: for basically everything else.

Same as java_artifact_odds but this time using spring so I can use it as a web application.
